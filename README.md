Created a bucket for object storage and access with upload, download, and list requests.
Requests allow the user to upload and download images. Uses UIImagePicker to select an image for upload. 
After upload, the table view reloads with uploaded image file name. 
By clicking on this table view cell, the image will be downloaded from the bucket.
